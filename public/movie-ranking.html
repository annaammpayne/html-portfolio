<h1>Anna's favourite movies</h1>
<h2>My top 3 movies of all time</h2>
<hr />
<h3>Fight Club</h3>
<p>I love the alter ego, consumer frustration and daily grind in vain messages of the movie. And of course, one of the best Brad Pitt and Edward Norton performances. A must-see.</p>
<h3>The Birds</h3>
<p>Alfred Hitchcock. A master. This movie, Psycho and Vertigo are all masterpieces.</p>
<h3>American Psycho</h3>
<p>A film that satirises 1980s yuppie culture and consumerism. I consider Christian Bale's portrayal of Patrick Bateman as one of his best performances ever.</p>
